# Bookends Scripts
This is a repository of scripts for [Bookends](http://www.sonnysoftware.com). 

## Set Metadata

The Set Metadata script is an Alfred workflow that sets the metadata of a PDF stored in Bookends. It requires that [Exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) is installed in your /usr/local/bin. In addition you need to create a Bookends format  called 'path' with only the symbol 'm' in the 'field order' field.
